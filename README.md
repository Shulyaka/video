Video recognition of landing pads for my quadrocopter project.
This is a computer vision project with Seeeduino Mega and Video Experimenter shield by Nootropic Design (http://www.nootropicdesign.com/ve/).
The task is to recognize landing pads with a (X) shape on board of my quadrocopter.
The code requires additional wires as described on this page: http://nootropicdesign.com/projectlab/2011/07/13/ve-on-the-seeeduino-mega/
and customized TVOut library (http://www.nootropicdesign.com/ve/downloads/TVout-VE.zip)
